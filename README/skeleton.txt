1. include/Grid.h / src/Grid.cpp

    Why? Keeps all map‑related code (border, interior, draw, collision check) together, so you can tweak or swap out the dungeon generator without touching game logic.

2. include/Game.h / src/Game.cpp

    Why? Encapsulates the game loop, input parsing, and player state. Makes it easy to add monsters, combat, or new commands later.
